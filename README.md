# Valley
*Valley* is a new bitcoin tool I hope to use to show how the bitcoin code I write works, to me and to others. 

The initial goal for *Valley* is to aid in the display and transformation of bitcoin transactions using existing open-source libraries and a bit of new TypeScript library code 

Other goals include working with lightning and ordinals.

Initially *Valley* is focussing on the use of bitcoin-js, bitcoin-core, bdk, ldk, and ord. 

All of these libraries have been written in JavaScript and Rust. *Valley* itself is to include a TypeScript library, separable from the tool.

*Valley* is open to taking a more polyglot approach over time, adding services as needed.
